# react-ts-scaffold
A template repo for scaffolding basic TypeScript/React projects

### Setup Instructions

1. Ensure that the latest versions of node and npm are installed
2. Install webpack, webpack-cli and webpack-dev-server globally: 
    * `npm install -g webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server`
3. Click on "Use this template", and create a new repo from it
4. Clone the new repo locally. From the root directory, run the following:
    1. `npm install`
    2. `npm run start`
5. Browse to http://localhost:8080

The React app should load correctly, and display a "Hello, World!" message.
